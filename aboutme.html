            <h2><i>Charm City</i></h2>
            <p class="host">Things are great when you have rats as roommates. <p id="top">Read More <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-coronavirus-rats-baltimore-20200429-blx2uheydzcdlm57xqi5lcaqby-story.html"> HERE</a></p>
            <p class="host">Baltimore has a massive rat problem that the locals have rallied around as a defining attribute of the city.</p>
            <P class="host">Most Baltimoreans utilize the BMORE Rat sticker on any surface that they can find. It seems to be a way of thumbing their nose at the rest of Maryland, which separates itself from Baltimore.</P>
            <p class="host">The best way to see the city is by walking the waterfront. Enjoy the sights, sounds, and even smells of some of the best restaurants and street art entertainment that Charm City has to offer. If you have the ability, you should swing by the many historic locations and become enriched in the cultural epicenter that is Fells Point and the surrounding historic neighborhoods. Baltimore offers a wide variety of outdoor locations to enjoy the fresh spring breeze or warm summer days; stop by Druid Hill or Canton Square to soak up the sun. Cool off with a refreshing shaved ice near the zoo or try one of the dozens of local micro-breweries that dot the landscape. Baltimore is a rich and vibrant city, so stop on by!</p>
